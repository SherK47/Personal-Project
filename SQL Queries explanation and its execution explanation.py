# ### Introduction
# 
# SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It provides a standardized way to interact with databases, allowing users to perform various operations such as querying, updating, inserting, and deleting data.
# 
# Here's a brief introduction to SQL and its importance in data analysis:
# 
# ### What is SQL?
# 
# 1. **Structured Query Language**: SQL is a domain-specific language designed for managing and manipulating structured data in relational database management systems (RDBMS).
#   
# 2. **Declarative Language**: SQL is a declarative language, meaning users specify what data they want to retrieve or manipulate, rather than specifying how to retrieve it. This makes SQL easy to write and understand.
# 
# 3. **Standardized Language**: SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard language, ensuring consistency and portability across different database systems.
# 
# ### Importance in Data Analysis:
# 
# 1. **Data Retrieval**: SQL allows users to retrieve data from databases using SELECT statements. This is essential for data analysis as it enables users to extract relevant information for analysis.
# 
# 2. **Data Manipulation**: SQL provides commands like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE for manipulating data in databases. Data analysts use these commands to modify existing data or add new data as needed.
# 
# 3. **Data Aggregation**: SQL supports aggregation functions such as SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, and COUNT, allowing analysts to summarize and aggregate data to derive insights.
# 
# 4. **Data Filtering and Sorting**: SQL enables users to filter and sort data based on specific criteria, facilitating data analysis by focusing on relevant subsets of data.
# 
# 5. **Data Joins**: SQL supports different types of joins (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN) to combine data from multiple tables. This is crucial for integrating data from different sources for analysis.
# 
# 6. **Data Transformation**: SQL can be used to transform data using functions like CASE statements, string functions, date functions, etc. This is useful for preparing data for analysis.
# 
# 7. **Data Integrity and Security**: SQL provides mechanisms for maintaining data integrity through constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys) and enforcing security through user authentication and access control.
# 
# 8. **Scalability and Performance**: SQL databases are highly scalable and optimized for performance, allowing analysts to work with large datasets efficiently.
# 
# In summary, SQL is a fundamental tool for data analysis, providing powerful capabilities for retrieving, manipulating, and analyzing structured data stored in databases. It plays a crucial role in various data-related tasks, making it an essential skill for data analysts and professionals working with data.

# 
# #### Execution Steps:
# 
# **Determine the Columns to Retrieve**:
#    - The query parser interprets the `SELECT *` part, meaning it needs to retrieve all columns from the specified table (`employees`).
# 
# **Identify the Data Source**:
#    - The query parser then looks at the `FROM employees` part to identify which table to query. 
# 
# **Access the Table**:
#    - The database engine accesses the `employees` table in the database. 
# 
# **Retrieve the Data**:
#    - The database engine retrieves all rows and all columns from the `employees` table.
# 
# **Return the Result**:
#    - The results (all columns for all rows) are returned and stored in the variable `rows`.
#

# The reason I used a Python function is because I couldn't utilize "std" and "sqrt" functions directly within the SQL command. Hence, I opted for Python instead. However, if you require the SQL query, here it is along with its execution steps.
# 
# ***SELECT department,</br> 
#        ROUND(STDDEV(salary), 2) AS stddev_salary</br>
# FROM employees</br>
# GROUP BY department;***</br>
# 
# The SQL query provided calculates the standard deviation of salaries for each department. Here's how the execution works step by step:
# #### Execution
# ***SELECT clause:***</br>
# - It specifies the columns to be retrieved in the result set. In this case, it selects the department column and the rounded standard deviation of the salary column as stddev_salary.
# 
# ***FROM clause:***</br>
# - It specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. Here, it's the employees table.
# 
# ***GROUP BY clause:***</br>
# - It groups the rows that have the same value in the department column into summary rows. Each group represents a unique department.
# 
# ***STDDEV function:***</br>
# - This is an aggregate function that computes the standard deviation of a set of values. It calculates the dispersion or variability of the salary values within each department group.
# 
# ***ROUND function:***</br>
# - It rounds the standard deviation values to two decimal places, making the output more readable.
# 
# ***Result set:***</br>
# - The query returns a result set with two columns: department and stddev_salary, where each row represents a department and its corresponding standard deviation of salaries
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# ***SELECT department,</br> 
#        AVG(salary) AS avg_salary,</br>
#        ROUND(AVG(salary * salary) - AVG(salary) * AVG(salary), 2) AS variance,</br>
#        ROUND(SQRT(ABS(AVG(salary * salary) - AVG(salary) * AVG(salary))), 2) AS stddev_salary</br>
# FROM employees</br>
# GROUP BY department;***</br>
# </br>
# The SQL query  provided calculates not only the average salary (avg_salary) for each department but also the variance and standard deviation of salaries within each department. Here's how the execution works step by step:
# #### Execution
# 
# ***SELECT clause:***</br>
# - It specifies the columns to be retrieved in the result set. In this case, it selects the department column, the average salary (AVG(salary)), the variance (ROUND(AVG(salary * salary) - AVG(salary) * AVG(salary), 2) AS variance), and the standard deviation (ROUND(SQRT(ABS(AVG(salary * salary) - AVG(salary) * AVG(salary))), 2) AS stddev_salary).
# 
# ***FROM clause:***</br>
# - It specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. Here, it's the employees table.
# 
# ***GROUP BY clause:***</br>
# - It groups the rows that have the same value in the department column into summary rows. Each group represents a unique department.
# 
# ***AVG function:***</br>
# - This is an aggregate function that computes the average of a set of values. It calculates the average salary for each department.
# 
# ***Variance calculation:***</br>
# - The expression AVG(salary * salary) - AVG(salary) * AVG(salary) calculates the variance of salaries within each department. It subtracts the square of the average salary from the average of the squares of salaries.
# 
# ***ROUND function (Variance):***</br>
# - It rounds the variance values to two decimal places, making the output more readable.
# 
# ***SQRT function:***</br>
# - This function calculates the square root of a given value. Here, it computes the square root of the absolute value of the variance to obtain the standard deviation.
# 
# ***ROUND function (Standard Deviation):***</br>
# - It rounds the standard deviation values to two decimal places, making the output more readable.
# 
# ***Result set:***</br>

# - It specifies the columns to be retrieved in the result set. In this case, it selects the name column from the departments table and a subquery that calculates the total salary spent on employees in each department.
# 
# ***Subquery:***</br>
# - The subquery (SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = departments.name) calculates the total salary for each department. It sums up the salary column from the employees table where the department matches the name of the department in the outer query.
# 
# ***FROM clause:***</br>
# - It specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. Here, it's the departments table.
#

# 
# 
# #### Execution:
# 
# ***Window Function (ROW_NUMBER()):***</br> 
# - The ROW_NUMBER() function assigns a unique sequential integer to each row within its partition.</br> 
# In this query:</br>

# Create a connection to the database (use the same database 'example.db')

# 
# The query calculates and retrieves the department(s) with the highest total budget by first summing budgets per department and then selecting the maximum total budget.
# #### Execution Steps
# 
# 1. **CTE Execution**:
#    - The database first executes the CTE part of the query.
#    - It scans the `departments` table and groups the rows by the `department` column.
#    - It calculates the sum of the `budget` for each department, resulting in a temporary result set (`dept_budgets`) with columns `department` and `total_budget`.
# 
# 2. **Subquery Execution**:
#    - The subquery `SELECT MAX(total_budget) FROM dept_budgets` is executed next.
#    - This subquery scans the `dept_budgets` CTE to find the maximum value of `total_budget`.
# 
# 3. **Main Query Execution**:
#    - The main query then executes, using the result of the subquery to filter the `dept_budgets` CTE.
#    - It selects the department(s) whose `total_budget` matches the maximum value found by the subquery.
#    - The result is a set of rows with the department(s) having the highest total budget and their respective budget values.
